					<h2>StreamDeck</h2>
					<p>Why a Stream Deck? If you have ever seen the Elgato Stream Deck, then there is no need to explain WHY. 
						Unfortunately the Stream Deck is an expensive tech, and that is why we designed our own Custom Deck.						
					</p>
					<p>At heart, this is really a custom keyboard and it can be used for many things. It could be used as a hotkey board, 
						to easily mute/unmute the microphone or decrease/increase the volume during meeting. It could also be configured to 
						open and close apps, execute a combination of keys to perform actions, like copy/paste, move between apps, etc.

					<h2>Starbuino</h2>
					<p>Looking for interesting projects to do with a LCD display and Arduino, I found there is a big number
						of Handheld Retro Game Consoles, and I was instantly excited about the idea to make my own.
					</p>
					<p>This wasn't as easy as it seemed. But I learnt a lot working on this.</p>
